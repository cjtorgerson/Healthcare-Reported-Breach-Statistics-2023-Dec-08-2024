# About
The data in `breach_report.csv` was collected from the public listing of data breaches reported to the [United States Department of Health and Human Services](https://ocrportal.hhs.gov/ocr/breach/breach_report.jsf).

The other CSVs are the data analysis that I did for a research paper on cybersecurity in the healthcare industry for a Systems Security course at Southern Utah University (paper not published at this time).

All of the code used to perform the analysis is in `data.py`.
